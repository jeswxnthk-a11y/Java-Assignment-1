The Inventory Management System is a console-based Java application developed to manage product records and stock details efficiently. The system allows users to add new products, view all products, search products by ID, delete products, and sell products while automatically updating stock quantities.This project is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as classes, objects, encapsulation, constructors, and modular design. It uses the Java Collections Framework (ArrayList) to store and manage product data dynamically.The application ensures accurate inventory tracking and prevents invalid transactions, such as selling more items than available in stock. This project demonstrates the practical implementation of Java programming concepts in a real-world inventory management scenario.
